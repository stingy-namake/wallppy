## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Wallpaper doesn't change on Linux

Wallppy supports multiple desktop environments. If automatic detection fails:

```bash
# GNOME (X11/Wayland)
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri "file:///path/to/image.jpg"

# KDE Plasma
plasma-apply-wallpaperimage /path/to/image.jpg

# Sway
swaymsg output * bg /path/to/image.jpg fill

# Hyprland
hyprctl hyprpaper preload /path/to/image.jpg
hyprctl hyprpaper wallpaper ",/path/to/image.jpg"
```

### App crashes on startup

1. Check the crash log at `~/.config/Wallppy/crash.log`
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Try running with: `python main.py --debug`

### Wayland-specific issues

If you experience crashes on Wayland, try running with:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland python main.py
```
